# ApiJWTAuthentication-PHR

This repository contains the Proof of Concept project for developing API Gateway Services based on .NET with JWT authentication at PT. Pertamina Hulu Rokan.

The project is developed using the .NET framework and JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication.

There are two microservices connected via the Ocelot API Gateway: the Equipment Microservice and the Well Microservice.

This project successfully integrated three APIs into the API Gateway Service, demonstrating the potential for efficient management of a larger API ecosystem.
